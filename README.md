# semios-devops-eval

Total Time Taken: ~1.75 hours

Important Points:
* This is coming from someone who has never used github actions before, I am certain this would be quicker for someone who has setup these kind of systems in the past (they might even find it quite easy)
* I feel that someone with proper github actions and repo config experience could manage this in less than an hour

* This design uses only two separate Github actions yml files. One of them is for the deploy and the other is for the testing.
* Extremely helpful to have the actions addon for surge (prevents the need for npm or any other shell scripting and probably cuts down the time a bunch)

* The revised assessment fixed the majority of my initial confusions
